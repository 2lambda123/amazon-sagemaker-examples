    "Today Amazon SageMaker is launching several additional features to the built-in linear learner algorithm.  Amazon SageMaker algorithms are designed to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and take advantage of the latest hardware optimizations for unparalleled speed.  The Amazon SageMaker linear learner algorithm encompasses both linear regression and binary classification algorithms.  These algorithms are used extensively in banking, fraud/risk management, insurance, and healthcare.  The new features of linear learner are designed to speed up training and help you customize models for different use cases.  Examples include classification with unbalanced classes, where one of your outcomes happens far less frequently than another.  Or specialized loss functions for regression, where itâ€™s more important to penalize certain model errors more than others.\n",

    "## Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear learner trains models using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or variants of SGD like Adam.  Training requires multiple passes over the data, called *epochs*, in which the data are loaded into memory in chunks called *batches*, sometimes called *minibatches*.  How do we know how many epochs to run?  Ideally, we'd like to continue training until convergence - that is, until we no longer see any additional benefits.  Running additional epochs after the model has converged is a waste of time and money, but guessing the right number of epochs is difficult to do before submitting a training job.  If we train for too few epochs, our model will be less accurate than it should be, but if we train for too many epochs, we'll waste resources and potentially harm model accuracy by overfitting.  To remove the guesswork and optimize model training, linear learner has added two new features: automatic early stopping and saving the best model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping works in two basic regimes: with or without a validation set.  Often we split our data into training, validation, and testing data sets.  Training is for optimizing the loss, validation is for tuning hyperparameters, and testing is for producing an honest estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data in the future.  If you provide linear learner with a validation data set, training will stop early when validation loss stops improving.  If no validation set is available, training will stop early when training loss stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early Stopping with a validation data set\n",
    "One big benefit of having a validation data set is that we can tell if and when we start overfitting to the training data.  Overfitting is when the model gives predictions that are too closely tailored to the training data, so that generalization performance (performance on future unseen data) will be poor.  The following plot on the right shows a typical progression during training with a validation data set.  Until epoch 5, the model has been learning from the training set and doing better and better on the validation set.  But in epochs 7-10, we see that the model has begun to overfit on the training set, which shows up as worse performance on the validation set.  Regardless of whether the model continues to improve (overfit) on the training data, we want to stop training after the model starts to overfit.  And we want to restore the best model from just before the overfitting started.  These two features are now turned on by default in linear learner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The default parameter values for early stopping are shown in the following code.  To tweak the behavior of early stopping, try changing the values.  To turn off early stopping entirely, choose a patience value larger than the number of epochs you want to run."

    "\n",
    "The loss function is our definition of the cost of making an error in prediction.  When we train a model, we push the model weights in the direction that minimizes loss, given the known labels in the training set.  The most common and well-known loss function is squared loss, which is minimized when we train a standard linear regression model.  Another common loss function is the one used in logistic regression, variously known as logistic loss, cross-entropy loss, or binomial likelihood.  Ideally, the loss function we train on should be a close match to the business problem we're trying to solve.  Having the flexibility to choose different loss functions at training time allows us to customize models to different use cases.  In this section, we'll discuss when to use which loss function, and introduce several new loss functions that have been added to linear learner."

    "Huber loss is an interesting hybrid of $\\text{L}_1$ and $\\text{L}_2$ losses.  Huber loss counts small errors on a squared scale and large errors on an absolute scale.  In the plot above, we see that Huber loss looks like squared loss when the error is near 0 and absolute loss beyond that.  Huber loss is useful when we want to train with squared loss, but want to avoid squared loss's sensitivity to outliers.  Huber loss gives less importance to outliers by not squaring the larger errors.  Read more about [Huber loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss) on wikipedia."

We have features and labels for over a quarter million credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or not fraudulent.  We'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.  This is a binary classification problem.  \n",

    "Next, we'll apply the linear learner threshold tuning functionality to get better precision without sacrificing recall.  Then, we'll push the precision even higher using the linear learner new class weights feature.  Because fraud can be extremely costly, we would prefer to have high recall, even if this means more false positives.  This is especially true if we are building a first line of defense, flagging potentially fraudulent transactions for further review before taking actions that affect customers."

    "#### Note on target vs. observed recall\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth taking some time to look more closely at these results.  If we asked linear learner for a model calibrated to a target recall of 0.9, then why didn't we get exactly 90% recall on the test set?  The reason is the difference between training, validation, and testing.  Linear learner calibrates thresholds for binary classification on the validation data set when one is provided, or else on the training set.  Since we did not provide a validation data set, the threshold were calculated on the training data.  Since the training, validation, and test data sets don't match exactly, the target recall we request is only an approximation.  In this case, the threshold that produced 90% recall on the training data happened to produce only 85-90% recall on the test data (due to some randomness in training, the results will vary from one run to the next).  The variation of recall in the test set versus the training set is dependent on the number of positive points. In this example, although we have over 280,000 examples in the entire dataset, we only have 337 positive examples, hence the large difference.  The accuracy of this approximation can be improved by providing a large validation data set to get a more accurate threshold, and then evaluating on a large test set to get a more accurate benchmark of the model and its threshold.  For even more fine-grained control, we can set the number of calibration samples to a higher number.  It's default value is already quite high at 10 million samples:\n",

    "We've just shown how to use the linear learner new early stopping feature, new loss functions, and new class weights feature to improve credit card fraud prediction.  Class weights can help you optimize recall or precision for all types of fraud detection, as well as other classification problems with rare events, like ad click prediction or mechanical failure prediction.  Try using class weights in your binary classification problem, or try one of the new loss functions for your regression problems: use quantile prediction to put confidence intervals around your predictions by learning 5% and 95% quantiles.  For more information about new loss functions and class weights, see the linear learner [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html)."
